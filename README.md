## Usage

Set a `PAT` secret in your repository settings in case you reach the API rate limit. `Repo` scope is sufficient.

Add this marker to your README.md where you want the language statistics to appear:

```markdown
<!-- simple-lang-stats -->
<!-- /simple-lang-stats -->
```

The action will automatically insert your language statistics between these markers.

Then, add it to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/update-stats.yml`):

```yaml
name: Update language stats

on:
  push:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */48 * * *'  # Run every 48 hours
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  update-stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write  # Allow writing to repository contents
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        
      - name: Update Language Stats
        uses: carolyn-sun/simple-lang-stats@latest
        with:
          PAT: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          username: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          
      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add README.md
          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "Update language statistics"
          git push
```
